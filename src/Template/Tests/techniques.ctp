<p>To understand a conversation properly you need to hear and understand specific details, the main gist as well as people's attitudes, emotions and opinions. Depending on your fluency, you will be able to focus on parts or all of those elements.

When doing an exercise you can choose to test yourself or to learn how to listen by practising a new technique.

We've separated them into three categories: Technique 1, 2 or 3.</p>

When that happens, you have to take notes because you can only retain 10 seconds in your head. When the recording is finished you go over your notes and try and work out what the conversation or presentation was about. If you are in this situation: GREAT! because in 15 minutes you will have learnt something new and improved in French! If you are reading this you are interested in doing something else than testing yourself, you actually would like to learn new expressions, new ideas and how to listen. When you are doing an exercise that requires 100% attention from you to understand the words, apply a T1 Technique. The more you practise these techniques, the better you will get at using them in an exam situation.";
